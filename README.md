# Multi-column editor
![Multi-column editor](https://raw.github.com/hssm/anki-addons/master/docs/multicolumn_browser.png)

## Rationale
If you're the kind of person who likes to have dozens and dozens of
field in your card type, this add-on is for you. In my personal use,
most field get very few content, such as a page number, a symbol,
etc... Those fields does not need to take the full width of the
window. This add-on simply allow you to have multiple field on a
single line.

Of course, some fields may contain a lot of text. In this case you may
want to take the full window width. This add-on also permit it. You
will have small fields and big fields.

## Configuration
The configuration is saved in anki's note type, so that when you
synchronize your collection, you'll have the same number of column
when you change your computer.

## Internal
It redefines the editor.js's method `setField`
